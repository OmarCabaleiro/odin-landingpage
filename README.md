This is my first landing page, 
and also my first time using CSS Flexbox in a project.

It is an assignment from The Odin Project.

In the "_project-guide" folder there are 2 images.
One shows a model of the webpage that I'm supposed to clone
("pixel-perfect" is not a requirement).
The other displays some of the parameters applied in creating that page.
